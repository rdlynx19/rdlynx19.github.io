The goal of this project was to design and program a low-level brushed DC motor controller using a PIC32MX170F256B microcontroller, capable of precise position control. This system was built from the ground up, combining real-time embedded programming, *UART* and *I2C* communication, and a multi-loop control structure for closed-loop motor control.

## Hardware Setup

The current hardware setup for the motor controller system includes the following components:

- **PIC32MX170F256B Microcontroller** : Serves as the core controller with UART communication, control loops & PWM signal generation
- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2** : Reads encoder pulses and transmits position data to PIC32
- **CP2102N USB-to-Serial Converter** : Enables UART-based programming and terminal communication between the PIC32 and a host computer
- **INA219 Current Sensor** : Monitors motor current via I2C for closed-loop current control
- **DRV8835 Dual H-Bridge Driver:** Drives the brushed DC motor using PWM and direction signals from the PIC32
- **Brushed DC Motor with Load Beam** : Mechanical actuator used for position tracking and load testing

The PIC32, CP2102N, and supporting components such as capacitors, resistors, switches, and LEDs were neatly integrated into a custom PCB designed by my cohort mate - <a href="https://benbenyamin.github.io/" target="_blank"> Ben Benyamin</a>.

## Firmware and Interface

The programming involved two components: firmware for the PIC32, written in C, and a Python-based interface running on the host computer.

### PIC32 Firmware

Two main control loops were implemented via timer-driven interrupts:
- **Current Control ISR (5 kHz)** : Implements a PI controller for maintaining target motor current
- **Position Control ISR (200 Hz)** : Implements a PID controller for tracking desired position trajectories

The PWM signal for driving the motor is generated using the Output Compare module at a frequency of 20 kHz. In the main program loop, a UART-based command parser listens for instructions from the Python terminal interface and executes commands such as setting control gains, loading trajectories, and enabling/disabling control modes.

### Python Interface

A terminal-based interface was built using pyserial to allow real-time communication with the motor controller. Users can input commands to tune gains, send reference trajectories, and view sensor data streamed from the PIC32 over UART.

## Control System

The control strategy followed a cascaded approach, tuning the inner current control loop, followed by the outer position loop.

### Current Control 
To tune the current loop, a 100 Hz square wave reference alternating between Â±200 mA was used. After adjusting the proportional and integral gains, a stable and responsive current tracking was achieved.

### Position Control

With current control stabilized, the position controller was tuned using both step and cubic spline trajectories. Gains were selected to ensure smooth tracking without overshoot or instability.
