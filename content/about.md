### About Me
Hi, I am currently an MS Robotics Student at Northwestern University.

I am currently working on co-operative indoor mapping using a quadrotor and a ground robot. Previously, I worked as a summer intern at the Multi-robot Systems Group at Czech Technical University where I worked on compensating rangefinder noise using sensor fusion.
