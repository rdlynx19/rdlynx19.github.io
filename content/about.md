## About Me


<aside class="aboutImg">
    <div class="aboutImg-content">
        <p align="left">
            Hi! I am an MS Robotics Student at Northwestern University. I am currently working on <a href="https://github.com/rdlynx19/multi-robot-mapping.git">Collaborative Mapping </a>. Previously, I was a summer intern at the Multi-robot Systems Group at Czech Technical University where I worked on compensating rangefinder noise using sensor fusion.<br>
            My ultimate goal is to develop algorithms for the safe deployment of robots in dense human environments.
