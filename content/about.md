## About Me

<div class="about-section">
  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      Hi! I am an MS Robotics Student at Northwestern University.
      I am currently working on simulating locomotion for a
      <a href="https://github.com/rdlynx19/HSA" target="_blank">Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSA)</a> robot.
      Previously, I was a summer intern at the Multi-robot Systems Group at Czech Technical University where I worked on compensating rangefinder noise using sensor fusion.
      <br><br>
      My ultimate goal is to develop algorithms for the safe deployment of robots in dense human environments.
